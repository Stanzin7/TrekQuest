This post dives deep into my application for the MLH Fellowship 2024 Cohort, my experiences, the motivation behind TrekQuest, and how this project embodies my journey in technology and open-source contribution. Whether you're here to explore the code, contribute, or find inspiration, I hope my story on Medium gives you a glimpse into the passion that drives this project.

TrekQuest is an open-source, collaborative project aimed at making travel more accessible, enjoyable, and community-driven. It's not just about the code; it's about building connections, sharing experiences, and creating something that brings real value to the travel community.

## Setting Up and Running Locally

Follow these steps to fork the repository, set it up locally, integrate with MongoDB, and configure the necessary environment variables for development.

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository:** Navigate to the GitHub page for TrekQuest and use the fork button to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stanzin7/TrekQuest.git

### Step 2: Set Up MongoDB

1. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Account:** Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for an account if you haven't already. Follow the steps to create a new cluster. For development purposes, you can select the free tier available.

2. **Configure Security Settings:** Within the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, navigate to the Network Access settings. Add a new IP address and select "Allow Access from Anywhere." This is recommended for development, but make sure to restrict access in a production environment.

3. **Create a Database User:** Still in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, go to the Database Access settings and add a new database user. Give this user read and write permissions to your database.

4. **Get Your Connection String:** After setting up your cluster, click on the "Connect" button, select "Connect your application," and copy the provided connection string. This will be used in your application's environment variables.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` File:** In the root directory of your cloned repository, create a new file named `.env`. This file will store sensitive and configuration-related information.

2. **Set Environment Variables:** Add the following content to your `.env` file, replacing placeholders with your actual data:

   ```plaintext
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE=mongodb+srv://snorzang65:<PASSWORD>@cluster0.bhbfxg7.mongodb.net/natours?retryWrites=true
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=Stanzin7
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
   JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=90
   EMAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
   EMAIL_USERNAME=<your_mailtrap_username>
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=<your_mailtrap_password>
   EMAIL_PORT=25
   
Ensure to replace <PASSWORD>, your_jwt_secret, your_mailtrap_username, and your_mailtrap_password with your actual MongoDB password, JWT secret, and Mailtrap credentials respectively.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required Node.js dependencies:

      ```sh
      cd TrekQuest
      npm install

### Step 5: Run the Application

To start the server and run your application locally, execute one of the following commands in the terminal, depending on your project's configuration:

- For a standard start script:

     ```sh
     npm start

### Step 6: Access the Application

With the server running, open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should now be able to view and interact with the TrekQuest application running locally on your machine.

TrekQuest consists of both frontend and backend components dedicated to travel enthusiasts. Whether you're exploring popular tours, creating new adventures, or collaborating with others, **TrekQuest** has got you covered. We aim for robust functionality and top-notch safety.

## Repository Structure

- **trekquest-frontend**: This folder contains the frontend code. Currently, Firebase serves it locally. Once the backend is complete, we'll host it together.
- **trekquest-backend**: This directory holds the backend API. It's undergoing development, with the end goal to be hosted on railway.app upon completion.

## 🚀 Features

- **Discover Tours**: Browse through curated tours to find your next adventure.
- **Create Tours**: Share unique tour ideas and gather fellow enthusiasts.
- **Collaborate**: Build connections, find new friends, and embark on mutual adventures.
- **Safety First**: Safety is our priority. All interactions on our platform are secure.

## 📌 API Endpoints

While the API currently offers basic CRUD operations, expanded functionalities are planned.

| Endpoint            | Description                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `GET /tours`        | Retrieve all available tours.       |
| `POST /tours`       | Create a new tour.                  |
| `GET /tours/:id`    | Fetch details of a specific tour.   |
| `PUT /tours/:id`    | Update a particular tour's details. |
| `DELETE /tours/:id` | Remove a tour from the platform.    |
